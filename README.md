Charter
=======
The purpose of this gem is to capture data to create a chart in an object, so that we can do the following things

- Render javascript graph, (which can be chart library agnostic)
- Create the chart data using ruby only (no js to render chart)
- Export chart as image (Needed when you want to email a chart)
- Configuration for chart colors

Note
----
The project is in progress. So please wait for the release.

The project is similar to [chartkick](http://chartkick.com/). The reason I am planning to create another project 
is because it does not support to export charts in image.
